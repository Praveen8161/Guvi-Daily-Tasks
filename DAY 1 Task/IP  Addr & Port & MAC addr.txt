1.An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. An IP address is either a 32-bit (IPv4) or a 128-bit (IPv6) number.

2.A port is an endpoint of communication in an operating system. It is associated with an IP address of the host and the protocol type of the communication. A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535.

3.HTTP methods are the standard methods used by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to perform various tasks on a web server. Some common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD.

4.A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. A MAC address is a six-byte hexadecimal address.

The main difference between an IP address and a MAC address is that an IP address is used to identify the connection of a device to a network, while a MAC address is used to ensure the physical address of the device on the network ยน. A port number is used to identify specific processes running on a device, while HTTP methods are used to perform specific actions on a web server.
